# sample

CJ is a lib aimed at increasing entropy in clojure developements (shorter, less error prone and more fun programs)

## Usage

Add this dependency to your project.clj: [cj "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]

For the shell functions (only thing working ATM):

(use 'cj.shell)

And now you can start doing stuff like:

(ls "~/Desktop")

(ls :la)

(git "status")

(lein "deps")

(wget :H "\"some-header\"" :H "\"another-header, why not\"" "fractalmedia.mx")

Differences between using this bash functions and invoking using sh, i.e. (sh "ls -la")

* If you give more than one argument, they will be concatenated with a space in between.

* If you give a keyword as an argument it will be converted this way: :keyword => -keyword


Thats kinda it.
